"""
The code below fetches temperature data from a (mocked) website for 4 cities
for every day of 2019, then calculates the average for each city.

* Read through the script to make sure you understand roughly what each stage
  is doing. (Part 1. is setting up a queue of tasks to run, Part 2. is making
  the requests and adding them to a results queue, and Part 3. is aggregating
  and printing the results)

* Update just Part 2. of this script so that instead of making all the requests
  on a single thread, it uses 50 worker threads. These should each take tasks
  from the task queue, and add results to the results queue.

  Make sure that:

    * All tasks are complete before the results are collected.
    * The program (and all threads) will terminate when the work is complete.
