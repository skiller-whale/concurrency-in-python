"""
The code below fetches temperature data from a (mocked) website for 4 cities
for every day of 2019, then calculates the average for each city.

Update the fetch_results function so that it:

* Creates an appropriate executor from the `concurrent.futures` module
* Uses the `executor.map` method to concurrently fetch all of the temperature
  results for each city (it might be easiest to call map once for each city)

The results dictionary created should be identical after your change.
